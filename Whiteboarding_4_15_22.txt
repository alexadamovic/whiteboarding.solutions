Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

*QUESTIONS*
- Can I assume the input will be a string?

stringToURL = function(string) {
  if (typeof string !== "string") {
    return "input is not a string";
  }
  sArray = string.split(" ");
  output = sArray.join("%20");
  return output;
}

// With recursion:

stringToURL = function(string) {
  if (typeof string !== "string") {
    return "input is not a string";
  }
  if (string.includes(" ") === false) {
    return string;
  }
  sArray = string.split(" ");
  output = sArray.join("%20");
  return stringToURL(output);
}


Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

*QUESTIONS*
- Will the input always be an array with at least 1 index value?

function doubleRemover(array) {
  let removeDoubleSet = new Set(array);
  let output = Array.from(removeDoubleSet)
  return output;
}

// With .filter

function doubleRemover()
